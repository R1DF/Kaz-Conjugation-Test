# Kazakh Conjugation Test
This is a project that can conjugate (regular) verbs in all 8 tenses of the Kazakh language.<br>
The used alphabet is the **Kazakh Cyrillic alphabet**, which is set to be replaced by the 2021 Latin version after 2023. Whether I'll update this project to include the Latin version too, I don't know.

## Tenses
This section will explain all of the existing tenses used in a brief manner.
1. **Continuous**<br>
The most common case. Can either be used for definitely happening future actions or actions in the present that happen regularly over time.
2. **Present**<br>
Represents actions specifically happening in the present. Has 2 variants.
3. **Past Simple**<br>
Represents actions that have happened in the past. The most common past tense.
4. **Future Motivative**<br>
Highlights an action that the subject is planning or desires to do. Might not happen, necessarily.
5. **Future Potential**<br>
Represents an action which might or might not happen in the future.
6. **Past Obvious**<br>
Represents an action that the speaker is absolutely confident happened, such as being a witness.
7. **Past Uncertain**<br>
Represents an action that the speaker is unsure whether it actually happened.
8. **Past Continuous**<br>
Represents actions in the past that have happened regularly or repeat.<br><br>

For more information, you can Google tenses individually or check [this website](https://kaz-tili.kz/glag.htm) out if you know Russian.

## Release?
No releases.<br>
I don't intend to make an executable out of this.<br>
If you really want to save it for some reason, then you need to have Python 3.10 (or earlier) on your computer and just download
everything from the `/src/` folder. You MUST keep all files in the same folder (one reserved just for those) and none of them must be moved around inside!
To run the project, simply open the Command prompt/Terminal, change the directory to the folder where `main.py` is and enter `py main.py`.

## Wait a second... You copied this README!
Yes, I did. It's in a similar format to the [Kazakh Declension Test](https://github.com/R1DF/Kaz-Declension-Test) one. I did it because both projects do similar things.
